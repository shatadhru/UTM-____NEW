# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Agent Guidelines - Learning Management System (LMS)

This repository is a full-featured **Learning Management System (LMS)** built with Next.js, Payload CMS 3.0, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, and Better Auth.

---

## 1. UI & Design Rules
- **No Sparkles Icon:** `Sparkles` icon from `lucide-react` (or any other icon library) is **strictly prohibited**. Never import or render `Sparkles`. Always use clear, contextual educational icons instead (e.g., `GraduationCap`, `BookOpen`, `Lightbulb`, `Users`, `CheckCircle2`, `Award`, `ShieldCheck`).
- **Must Use Shadcn UI:** Do NOT build custom reinvented UI primitives (e.g., custom dropdowns, custom modals, custom tooltips, custom buttons). Always use official Shadcn UI components located in `@/components/ui/` (managed via Shadcn MCP / CLI).
- **Tailwind CSS:** Freely utilize Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling, responsive layouts, typography, and spacing.

---

## 2. Code Quality & Minimalism (Ponytail Philosophy)
- **Simple & Minimal Code:** Keep code straightforward, readable, and clean. Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers, over-engineering, or over-complicated design patterns.
- **The Ponytail Philosophy:** "The best code is the code you never wrote." Reuse existing project utilities and native platform features rather than writing redundant boilerplate.
- **Basic Language Constructs:** Rely on fundamental JavaScript/TypeScript features — clear functions, well-structured objects, arrays, and classes.

---

## 3. Performance & Time Complexity (Big-O)
- **Optimal Operations:** Always consider Big-O time and space complexity in data handling:
  - Use `Map` or `Set` for $O(1)$ lookups instead of nested array searches ($O(N^2)$).
  - Ensure loops, filters, and transforms are linear and efficient ($O(N)$).
  - Keep sorting operations bounded ($O(N \log N)$) and leverage database-level indexing wherever possible.
  - Implement pagination with explicit limits on queries to avoid unbounded memory consumption.

---

## 4. Security & Attack Prevention (Critical)

### 4.1. Brute Force Attack Mitigation
- Implement and enforce strict rate limiting on all sensitive endpoints (login, register, password reset, checkout, OTP verification).
- Track requests by IP address and user identifier.
- Implement exponential backoff or temporary account lockout after multiple consecutive failed attempts.
- Use constant-time comparisons for sensitive token/hash checks.
- Ensure strong password hashing (bcrypt / argon2) via Better Auth.

### 4.2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) & CSRF Mitigation
- **XSS Prevention:**
  - Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless explicitly sanitized using an established sanitizer (e.g., DOMPurify).
  - Validate and sanitize all user input before storing or rendering.
  - Enforce strict Content Security Policy (CSP) headers and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
- **CSRF Protection:**
  - Enforce `trustedOrigins` in Better Auth and Payload CMS for all state-changing requests (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
  - Ensure cookies use `SameSite=Lax` or `SameSite=Strict` and `HttpOnly; Secure` in production.

### 4.3. DDoS & Privilege Escalation Mitigation
- **DDoS Mitigation:**
  - Enforce request payload size limits on API routes.
  - Apply pagination limits (e.g., max 50–100 items per query) to prevent memory exhaustion and heavy DB scans.
  - Cache high-traffic static/semi-static data (e.g., course catalogs, banners) using Next.js ISR.
- **Privilege Escalation Prevention:**
  - Never trust client-supplied user roles, user IDs, or permissions.
  - Always verify session authenticity and user roles on the server (`req.user.role === 'admin'`).
  - Restrict administrative collections and fields via Payload CMS collection-level and field-level access control (`adminOnlyFieldAccess`).

### 4.4. Safe & Proper bKash Payment Integration
- **Server-Side Only Execution:** Never expose bKash credentials (`BKASH_APP_KEY`, `BKASH_APP_SECRET`, `BKASH_PASSWORD`, `BKASH_USERNAME`) to the client. All token grants, payment creation, and execution must run server-side using `'server-only'`.
- **Token Verification:** Ensure the bKash `id_token` is retrieved server-to-server and never transmitted to the browser.
- **Idempotency & Replay Attack Defense:**
  - Prevent duplicate execution: Verify that an order's `paymentID` / `trxID` has not already been used or fulfilled in the database before completing an order.
  - Once processed, mark the order status atomically to prevent race conditions.
- **Amount Verification:** Before confirming an order, verify that the executed payment amount returned by bKash matches the calculated order total in the database.

---

## 5. Communication
- **Always reply in Bangla:** All user-facing explanations, status updates, and communications must be in clear and concise Bangla.





Concise rules for building accessible, fast, delightful UIs. Use MUST/SHOULD/NEVER to guide decisions.

## Interactions

### Keyboard

- MUST: Full keyboard support per [WAI-ARIA APG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)
- MUST: Visible, unobscured focus rings (`:focus-visible`; group with `:focus-within`); sticky/fixed elements never cover focus
- MUST: Manage focus (trap, move, return) per APG patterns
- NEVER: `outline: none` without visible focus replacement

### Targets & Input

- MUST: Hit target ≥24px (mobile ≥44px); if visual <24px, expand hit area
- MUST: Mobile `<input>` font-size ≥16px to prevent iOS zoom
- NEVER: Disable browser zoom (`user-scalable=no`, `maximum-scale=1`)
- MUST: `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom
- SHOULD: Set `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` to match design

### Forms

- MUST: Hydration-safe inputs (no lost focus/value)
- NEVER: Block paste in `<input>`/`<textarea>`
- MUST: Loading buttons show spinner and keep original label
- MUST: Enter submits focused input; in `<textarea>`, ⌘/Ctrl+Enter submits
- MUST: Keep submit enabled until request starts; then disable with spinner
- MUST: Accept free text, validate after—don't block typing
- MUST: Allow incomplete form submission to surface validation
- MUST: Errors inline next to fields; on submit, focus first error
- MUST: `autocomplete` + meaningful `name`; correct `type` and `inputmode`
- SHOULD: Disable spellcheck for emails/codes/usernames
- SHOULD: Placeholders end with `…` and show example pattern
- MUST: Warn on unsaved changes before navigation
- MUST: Compatible with password managers & 2FA; allow pasting codes
- MUST: Trim values to handle text expansion trailing spaces
- MUST: No dead zones on checkboxes/radios; label+control share one hit target

### State & Navigation

- MUST: URL reflects state (deep-link filters/tabs/pagination/expanded panels)
- MUST: Back/Forward restores scroll position
- MUST: Links use `<a>`/`<Link>` for navigation (support Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click)
- NEVER: Use `<div onClick>` for navigation

### Feedback

- SHOULD: Optimistic UI; reconcile on response; on failure rollback or offer Undo
- MUST: Confirm destructive actions or provide Undo window
- MUST: Use polite `aria-live` for toasts/inline validation
- SHOULD: Ellipsis (`…`) for options opening follow-ups ("Rename…") and loading states ("Loading…")

### Touch & Drag

- MUST: Generous targets, clear affordances; avoid finicky interactions
- MUST: Delay first tooltip; subsequent peers instant
- MUST: `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals/drawers
- SHOULD: When suppressing page rubber-band bounce, set `overscroll-behavior: none` on `<html>` inside `@media (pointer: fine)`; keep coarse-pointer page defaults for pull-to-refresh. Test hybrid touch devices: `pointer` describes the primary input, and `none` also disables scroll chaining and native swipe navigation
- MUST: During drag, disable text selection and set `inert` on dragged elements
- MUST: Drag/swipe/pinch/path gestures have a tap/click and keyboard alternative unless essential
- MUST: If it looks clickable, it must be clickable

### Autofocus

- SHOULD: Autofocus on desktop with single primary input; rarely on mobile

## Animation

- MUST: Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (provide reduced variant or disable)
- SHOULD: Prefer CSS > Web Animations API > JS libraries
- MUST: Animate compositor-friendly props (`transform`, `opacity`) only
- NEVER: Animate layout props (`top`, `left`, `width`, `height`)
- NEVER: `transition: all`—list properties explicitly
- SHOULD: Animate only to clarify cause/effect or add deliberate delight
- SHOULD: Choose easing to match the change (size/distance/trigger)
- MUST: Animations interruptible and input-driven; autoplay only for muted, non-essential loops
- MUST: Autoplay motion >5s alongside other content has pause, stop, or hide controls
- MUST: Correct `transform-origin` (motion starts where it "physically" should)
- MUST: SVG transforms on `<g>` wrapper with `transform-box: fill-box`

## Layout

- SHOULD: Optical alignment; adjust ±1px when perception beats geometry
- MUST: Deliberate alignment to grid/baseline/edges—no accidental placement
- SHOULD: Balance icon/text lockups (weight/size/spacing/color)
- MUST: Verify mobile, laptop, ultra-wide (simulate ultra-wide at 50% zoom)
- MUST: Respect safe areas (`env(safe-area-inset-*)`)
- MUST: Avoid unwanted scrollbars; fix overflows
- SHOULD: Flex/grid over JS measurement for layout

## Content & Accessibility

- SHOULD: Inline help first; tooltips last resort
- MUST: Skeletons mirror final content to avoid layout shift
- MUST: `<title>` matches current context
- MUST: No dead ends; always offer next step/recovery
- MUST: Design empty/sparse/dense/error states
- SHOULD: Curly quotes (“ ”); avoid widows/orphans (`text-wrap: balance`)
- MUST: `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for number comparisons
- MUST: Redundant status cues (not color-only); icons have text labels
- MUST: Accessible names exist even when visuals omit labels
- MUST: Use `…` character (not `...`)
- MUST: `scroll-margin-top` on headings; "Skip to content" link; hierarchical `<h1>`–`<h6>`
- MUST: Resilient to user-generated content (short/avg/very long)
- MUST: Locale-aware dates/times/numbers (`Intl.DateTimeFormat`, `Intl.NumberFormat`)
- SHOULD: `translate="no"` on brand names, code tokens, & identifiers to prevent garbled auto-translation
- MUST: Accurate `aria-label`; decorative elements `aria-hidden`
- MUST: Icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label`
- MUST: Prefer native semantics (`button`, `a`, `label`, `table`) before ARIA
- MUST: Media has captions/transcripts/descriptions as applicable; controls are keyboard-operable; decorative media hidden from assistive tech
- MUST: Non-breaking spaces: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;K`, brand names

## Content Handling

- MUST: Text containers handle long content (`truncate`, `line-clamp-*`, `break-words`)
- MUST: Flex children need `min-w-0` to allow truncation
- MUST: Handle empty states—no broken UI for empty strings/arrays

## Performance

- SHOULD: Test iOS Low Power Mode and macOS Safari
- MUST: Measure reliably (disable extensions that skew runtime)
- MUST: Track and minimize re-renders (React DevTools/React Scan)
- MUST: Profile with CPU/network throttling
- MUST: Batch layout reads/writes; avoid reflows/repaints
- MUST: Mutations (`POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) target <500ms
- SHOULD: Prefer uncontrolled inputs; controlled inputs cheap per keystroke
- MUST: Virtualize large lists (>50 items)
- MUST: Preload above-fold images; lazy-load the rest
- MUST: Prevent CLS (explicit image dimensions)
- SHOULD: `<link rel="preconnect">` for CDN domains
- SHOULD: Critical fonts: `<link rel="preload" as="font">` with `font-display: swap`
- SHOULD: `<video autoplay muted loop playsinline>` over animated GIF; provide still/reduced-motion alternative
- SHOULD: Short non-essential loops include a Safari H.264 MP4 `<picture>` source, `prefers-reduced-motion` media condition, and still fallback

## Dark Mode & Theming

- MUST: `color-scheme: dark` on `<html>` for dark themes
- SHOULD: `<meta name="theme-color">` matches page background
- MUST: Native `<select>`: explicit `background-color` and `color` (Windows fix)

## Hydration

- MUST: Inputs with `value` need `onChange` (or use `defaultValue`)
- SHOULD: Guard date/time rendering against hydration mismatch

## Design

- SHOULD: Layered shadows (ambient + direct)
- SHOULD: Crisp edges via semi-transparent borders + shadows
- SHOULD: Nested radii: child ≤ parent; concentric
- SHOULD: Hue consistency: tint borders/shadows/text toward bg hue
- MUST: Accessible charts (color-blind-friendly palettes)
- MUST: Meet contrast—prefer [APCA](https://apcacontrast.com/) over WCAG 2
- MUST: Increase contrast on `:hover`/`:active`/`:focus`
- SHOULD: Match browser UI to bg
- SHOULD: Avoid dark color gradient banding (use background images when needed)
